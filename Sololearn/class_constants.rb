A class can also contain constants. Remember, 
constants variables do not change their value and
start with capital letter. It is common to have
uppercase names for constants, as in: 
=end
class Calc
    PI = 3.14
end

# You can access constants using the class name,
# followed by two colo symbols (::) and the 
# constant name, for example:

puts Calc::PI

# Run the code and see how it works!

# Drage and drop from the options below to output
# the constant ID of the Test class:
# Options: Test, ID, const, <<, self.
puts Test::ID
